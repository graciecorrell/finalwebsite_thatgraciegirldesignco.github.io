            <h2>GET TO KNOW ME</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I'm Gracie! 
I'm a girl in my 20s, who loves Jesus, is from the middle of nowhere Nebraska, an overcomer (I lost my dad to cancer), loves to travel, is a brand influencer + graphic design student, and has big dreams to make an impact on the world! 
5 years ago I started a journey helping girls like me find their confidence and freedom! 
Now, 5 years and 4 businesses later...I've learned a lot and have refined what I offer down to two businesses that offer high quality service and products. When I meet with a new client I like to sit down and get to know them.
I want to know your goals and what makes you...YOU! When we are done with your photos or marketing material it needs to ultimately reflect you. My job is to make you feel good on the inside, and look good on the outside!
We are all designed for greatness and nothing makes me happier that helping you achieve what you're going after.
That's what I get to do with my life!
I'm living my life with time freedom and feeling confident in my own skin + helping others do the same thing! </p>

	   <p>Sometimes music can say everything that words can't get across.<br/>
	   This song is the kind of vibe I like to put behind all my work.</p>
